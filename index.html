            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="IMG_1096.jpg" alt="Picture of myself">
            <p>My name is Diego Haro, and I am passionate about coding. I find great satisfaction in solving
                problems and building things from the ground up. I am always eager to learn new technologies,
                programming languages, and tools to continue growing as a developer. The challenge of mastering new
                concepts and pushing my limits keeps me motivated and excited every day.

                What I value most, however, is helping others. Whether it’s troubleshooting a difficult bug, explaining
                a complex concept, or guiding someone just starting out, I’m always ready to offer support. I believe in
                the power of collaboration and enjoy being part of a community where we can all share our input and
                learn from each other. I am committed to both my personal development and helping others along their
                coding journey.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>My interests are on creating connections with people, health, and personal development. I have an overwhelming 
            desire to learn new things and am constantly looking to broaden my knowledge. Another important aspect of my 
            life is working out, which keeps me focused and mentally sharp in addition to keeping me in shape. For me, 
            cooking is a creative outlet that lets me experiment with flavors and ingredients while providing nourishment 
            for both myself and other people. Last but not least, I genuinely enjoy meeting new people since it expands my 
            perspective, opens me to all kinds of experiences, and cultivates deep connections. All of these interests help 
            me stay balanced and grow as a person.
